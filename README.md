## A responsive, accessible photo gallery web app powered by React

### This is a work in progress.

This is a responsive photo gallery web [app](https://taragrimm.com) that I designed, developed and deployed.  The site is powered by React and was deployed using AWS S3.  It is using React Router and some portions are using Flexbox.  

I am also working on a Ruby on Rails API backend that will allow me to include an admin page that performs simple CRUD operations for the images.
